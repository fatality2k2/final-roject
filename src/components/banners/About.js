          Did you know that every person in the US receives around 32 text
          messages per day? It’s a pretty big deal, isn’t it? We’re using SMS to
          inform our family members we’ll be late for dinner, share new
          experiences, jokes or ideas with our friends or postpone meetings due
          to ever growing traffic. It’s simple, fast and convenient. Now, tell
          me, how many text messages have you already received or sent today?
          I’m quite sure you never leave your smartphone lying around. Maybe
          you’re even reading this article from your cell? If not, it’s surely
          in your bag, pocket or next to your laptop. You need to keep it close.
          After all, who knows what great news the next SMS will bring? You
          don’t want to miss it, do you? Since we’re so dependent on our cell
          phones and receive dozens of messages daily, why then are you not
          taking advantage of it? Why don’t you use SMS as means to inform your
          customers about new products, time-limited offers or discounts? Your
          competitors do. They’ve already started casting spells on your
          customers with every text message, offering them their cool gadgets
          and services. They want to turn your loyal customers to the dark side.
          Are you going to let that happen? Are you going to let them steal your
          customers? If not, then it’s about time to act! As Wendy Clark once
          said: “If your plans don’t include mobile, your plans are not
          finished.”
